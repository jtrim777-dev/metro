# Metro Mod

Modifications to Minecraft's Villages to make them a more lively metropolis.

## Features

- **Coins:** Villagers like emeralds, but they've decided to move on from an economy based solely on them. Instead,
  you can trade with them using the currency known as Cubits. A Copper Coin is worth 1 Cubit, an Iron Coin 16 Cubits,
  and a Gold Coin 64 Cubits. Villagers will buy and sell all their items in exchange for some Cubits.
